Capstone: Square Dance
===
This is the code for the microcontroller of a smart chessboard project at the University of Virginia. At some point, this document will be updated to explain the project and link to our theses. At the moment, things are volatile and we haven't written our theses.

Drivers:
 - [x] LED
 - [x] Sensor array (todo: measure noise concerns)
 - [ ] UART with Pi
 - [ ] 7-segment (mostly done)
 - [ ] Buttons

Test benches:
 - [ ] LED
 - [ ] Sensor array
 - [ ] UART with Pi
 - [ ] 7-segment
 - [ ] Buttons
