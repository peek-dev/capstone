Turn on O3.
Delay:
 - jump to moves, leverage pre-sorting.
 - wait for closer to noise, not noise itself
 - make clock, led drivers asynchronous
 - crank up sweep frequency?
 - optimize searching to jump directly to likely-false squares

Power:
 - turn off rpi bluetooth and wifi, maybe hdmi if we feel unbelievably confident?
